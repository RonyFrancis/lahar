*Lahar* is a small Express based API to create REST endpoint for Chatscript. You can host this on the same server as Chatscript or as a proxy server.

Its goal is to provide one or multiple endpoints that can be reached across different devices using normalized HTTP requests. In other words, *Lahar* takes care of the backend and socket piping, so you can communicate with ChatScript using POST and GET.
